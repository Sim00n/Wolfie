This is a simple platform jumping game created in the spirit of Stony Brook University's mascot - Wolfie.
The idea is based on a game called Icy Tower published at the end of 2001, which it self was based on a 1997 game called XJump.

* The basic mechanics require you to jump up and climb the platforms.
* If you hit the ground the game is over.
* You can jump while standing on a platform or while being near a wall.
* Jumping onto a wall will increase your horizontal speed and launch you upward.
* There is friction and maximum speed when moving horizontally.
* Jumping out of the frame speeds up all the platforms and you can't jump again until the character is back in the frame.

Important stuff
---------------------------------------------------
* Stony Brook University has nothing to do with this program. It was created to honor the mascot and the spirit of the school but I as an author have no legal rights to the Wolfie mascot it's name.
* All the graphics have been created by myself and are not infringing on any copyrights.
* The game is in an early alpha phase and has no clear goal, no concise levels or anything that would be worth publishing as a finished product. Work in progress people! :)
* There are a bunch of bugs that I will work on. I know of every single one of them.

Keys
---------------------------------------------------
* A, D, or arrows - to move left or right
* Space or arrow up - to jump
* R - to restart after a loss
* ESC - to exit

Bugs
---------------------------------------------------
* Sometimes jumping off a platform doesn't work.
* You can jump off a wall all you want and keep climbing.
* Randomly generated platforms can sometimes be rendered on top of the borders.
* Physics work kind of funky
